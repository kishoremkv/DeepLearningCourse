Meanwhile , the number of dead in Somalia has climbed to at least 132 people , although the Associated Press quotes a senior Somali official as putting the number at 200 .
Many others remain missing .
The United Nations says it is difficult to get a clear picture of both the number of those killed and the extent of the damage because the region is remote and the conditions are harsh .
The U.N. World Food Program began distributing relief supplies Wednesday in the town of Hafun on the northern coast of Somalia .
The tsunami also took lives in Tanzania , Seychelles and Kenya .

Pakistan 's Information Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed made the announcement Tuesday , saying Pakistan needs his leadership .
He did not say if he would also continue as the army chief .

He then won a parliamentary vote of confidence a year later .
Uganda 's main opposition leader Kizza Besigye has pleaded not guilty to charges of treason .
Twenty two co-defendants also entered pleas of innocence during a hearing in Uganda 's High Court Tuesday .
Besigye 's supporters say the treason charge is one of several the government made up to keep him from making an effective challenge to President Yoweri Museveni in recent elections .
Museveni won the February election but Besigye 's party has asked the Ugandan Supreme Court to nullify the results .
The High Court dropped rape charges against Besigye last month , and President Museveni said Besigye would not be tried by a military court that had charged him with terrorism and illegal arms possession .
The treason trial proceedings have been adjourned until Wednesday because the court did not have a translator for the first prosecution witness , a woman who speaks the Acholi language .

Google won a key European Union court ruling on trademark issues Tuesday .
The European Court of Justice , Europe 's highest court , said Google did not violate luxury goods trademarks by allowing companies to buy other companies ' brand names as advertising key words .
Google is the world 's most-widely used Internet search company , and it makes tens of billions of dollars a year by selling the right to display advertisements next to search results .
Luxury goods makers like Luis Vuitton complained that competitors were buying the right to use Luis Vuitton brand names as key words .
That could guide customers to buy goods at web sites run by Vuitton 's competitors , including counterfeiters .
The European Court of Justice said Google must remove the advertisements quickly if trademark holders show the ads are used for illegal activity like selling counterfeit goods .

The easing of prices follows a U.S. government report on Wednesday showing an increasing supply of crude oil in the U.S. market , and growing refinery operations to turn out gasoline .
While prices have dropped , they are still about 44 percent higher than they were a year ago .
Most economists surveyed by the Bloomberg financial news service say high oil prices and rising interest rates will slow U.S. economic growth later this year .

Russian news media reports say prosecutors have released two of 10 suspects detained in the killing of investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya .
The reports Thursday say authorities freed Oleg Alimov and Alexei Berkin .
Russian Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika Monday announced the arrest of 10 people in the case .
He said the murder was organized by a Chechen emigre who had led a group of contract killers in Moscow .
He said evidence as to a motive pointed to what he called attempts from abroad to destabilize Russia and discredit its leaders .
Russian news media reports earlier had named an agent of the Federal Security Service , Pavel Ryaguzov , as one of the suspects in the case .
But a military court in Moscow Thursday said his arrest is not linked to Politkovskaya 's murder .

Christians revere Bethlehem as the birthplace of Jesus .
Archbishop Williams has been visiting the Holy Land before Christmas with other church leaders from Britain .

In a report released Sunday , New York based Human Rights Watch said the findings come from first-hand accounts from U.S. military personnel .
The report alleges that detainee abuse was an established and apparently authorized part of the detention and interrogation process .
Human Rights Watch used the report to call for a Congressional investigation into the scope of detainee abuse and allegations of involvement by higher level officials .
But the U.S. Defense Department has said that multiple reviews of prisoner interrogation methods have concluded that no uniformed or civilian leaders directed or encouraged the prisoner abuses committed in Iraq .

British officials are denying a newspaper report that London is urging the United States to set a timetable for withdrawing troops from Iraq .
A spokesman for the office of Prime Minister Tony Blair said Thursday that what is important is not a timetable but to help Iraq while it determines its own future .
He said Britain 's troops will remain in Iraq as long as authorities there want them .
He was responding to a report in London 's Daily Telegraph newspaper , which quoted an unnamed government source as reporting that the Blair administration hopes to have the United States agree to announce a timetable .
The newspaper report said that setting the timetable would be an indication that U.S.-led coalition troops do not intend to stay in Iraq indefinitely .
The report said the announcement would bolster Iraq 's interim government and undermine insurgents in that country .

Mr. Goss says the CIA takes a neutral position on Senator McCain 's proposal , adding that some techniques restricted by the measure have yielded valuable intelligence .
Despite a slowdown in the U.S. economy , the amount of goods the United States ships overseas recently increased .
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce , U.S. exports in the second quarter of 2008 expanded at an annualized rate of nine-point-two percent , thanks in large part to a decline in the value of the dollar against other currencies Many U.S. exporters are benefiting from the weak dollar , which makes American goods cheaper abroad , and boosts U.S. firms ' profits when they convert overseas earnings back into dollars .
But as Nathan King reports for VOA , it is not just large global corporations that are benefiting .

The state-run Herald newspaper reports the six are also banned from running in key parliamentary elections in March .
The officials , including Energy Minister July Moyo , were initially suspended for six months .
They were accused last month of holding a secret meeting to oppose President Robert Mugabe 's choice of second vice president .
The post , granted to a woman for the first time in Zimbabwe 's history , is seen as a stepping stone for the presidency once Mr. Mugabe retires .

The lands that today comprise Croatia were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the close of World War I .
In 1918 , the Croats , Serbs , and Slovenes formed a kingdom known after 1929 as Yugoslavia .
Following World War II , Yugoslavia became a federal independent Communist state under the strong hand of Marshal TITO .
Although Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 , it took four years of sporadic , but often bitter , fighting before occupying Serb armies were mostly cleared from Croatian lands .
Under UN supervision , the last Serb-held enclave in eastern Slavonia was returned to Croatia in 1998 .
In April 2009 , Croatia joined NATO ; it is a candidate for eventual EU accession .
A military power during the 17th century , Sweden has not participated in any war for almost two centuries .
An armed neutrality was preserved in both world wars .
Sweden 's long-successful economic formula of a capitalist system interlarded with substantial welfare elements was challenged in the 1990s by high unemployment and in 2000 - 2 and 2009 by the global economic downturns , but fiscal discipline over the past several years has allowed the country to weather economic vagaries .
Sweden joined the EU in 1995 , but the public rejected the introduction of the euro in a 2003 referendum .
The economy , one of the most stable and prosperous in the Caribbean , is highly dependent on tourism generating an estimated 45 % of the national income .
More than 9,34,000 tourists , mainly from the US , visited the islands in 2008 .
In the mid-1980s , the government began offering offshore registration to companies wishing to incorporate in the islands , and incorporation fees now generate substantial revenues .
Roughly 4,00,000 companies were on the offshore registry by yearend 2000 .
The adoption of a comprehensive insurance law in late 1994 , which provides a blanket of confidentiality with regulated statutory gateways for investigation of criminal offenses , made the British Virgin Islands even more attractive to international business .
Livestock raising is the most important agricultural activity ; poor soils limit the islands ' ability to meet domestic food requirements .
Because of traditionally close links with the US Virgin Islands , the British Virgin Islands has used the US dollar as its currency since 1959 .
Sri Lanka is engaging in large-scale reconstruction and development projects following the end of the 26-year conflict with the LTTE , including increasing electricity access and rebuilding its road and rail network .
Additionally , Sri Lanka seeks to reduce poverty by using a combination of state directed policies and private investment promotion to spur growth in disadvantaged areas , develop small and medium enterprises , and promote increased agriculture .
High levels of government funding may be difficult , as the government already is faced with high debt interest payments , a bloated civil service , and historically high budget deficits .
The 2008 - 9 global financial crisis and recession exposed Sri Lanka 's economic vulnerabilities and nearly caused a balance of payments crisis , which was alleviated by a $ 2.6 billion IMF standby agreement in July 2009 .
The end of the civil war and the IMF loan , however , have largely restored investors ' confidence , reflected in part by the Sri Lankan stock market 's recognition as one of the best performing markets in the world .
Sri Lankan growth rates averaged nearly 5 % in during the war , but increased government spending on development and fighting the LTTE in the final years spurred GDP growth to around 06-Jul % per year in 2006 - 8 .
After experiencing 3.5 % growth in 2009 , Sri Lanka 's economy is poised to achieve high growth rates in the postwar period .
A MAN wished to purchase an Ass , and agreed with its owner that he should try out the animal before he bought him .
He took the Ass home and put him in the straw-yard with his other Asses , upon which the new animal left all the others and at once joined the one that was most idle and the greatest eater of them all .
Seeing this , the man put a halter on him and led him back to his owner .
On being asked how , in so short a time , he could have made a trial of him , he answered , ' I do not need a trial ; I know that he will be just the same as the one he chose for his companion . '
A man is known by the company he keeps .
A MIDDLE-AGED MAN , whose hair had begun to turn gray , courted two women at the same time .
One of them was young , and the other well advanced in years .
The elder woman , ashamed to be courted by a man younger than herself , made a point , whenever her admirer visited her , to pull out some portion of his black hairs .
The younger , on the contrary , not wishing to become the wife of an old man , was equally zealous in removing every gray hair she could find .
Thus it came to pass that between them both he very soon found that he had not a hair left on his head .
Those who seek to please everybody please nobody .
Lena once had two chickens .
One of them got terribly sick .
So she killed the other one to make soup to get the first one well again .
John Garang
The Sudan People 's Liberation Movement says funeral services for its late political leader , Sudanese Vice President John Garang , will be held in Juba , the planned capital of an autonomous southern Sudan .
It is unclear when the funeral will be held .
Mr. Garang 's political party says the body of the former rebel leader , who died Saturday evening in a helicopter crash , is lying at New Site in Southern Sudan .
Sudan 's government on Monday declared a night curfew in the capital , Khartoum , to prevent riots that erupted following news of his death .
At least 36 people were killed in the violence .
Mr. Garang was a key figure in the peace accord reached this year between the Sudanese government and southern rebels to end a 21-year civil war .
Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir and General Salva Kiir Mayardit , who was named by the SPLM to succeed Mr. Garang , have stressed that his death will not stop the peace movement .
From the dazzling Opening Ceremonies to the number of gold medals won , China 's Olympic performance has been a source of great national pride .

Democrats are under pressure to delay the vote as long as possible to build public opposition to Mr. Alito 's nomination .
Liberal interest groups are concerned his presence could tilt the court in a more conservative direction .
Mr. Alito managed to withstand two days of tough questioning from Democrats , and observers say he will easily be confirmed in the Republican-controlled Senate .
NATO said Saturday one of its operations in Afghanistan has resulted in the deaths of two civilians and the wounding of another .

More than 500 people died .
The Supreme Court Tuesday upheld a lower court ruling that said the Japanese government did not neglect its responsibility when the incident occurred and does not need to apologize .
The United States has denied any rift between Washington and Seoul , after a South Korean official made a statement about North Korea that conflicts with the official U.S. position .
In Washington , a U.S. State Department spokesman emphasized Thursday that the ongoing six-party negotiations on North Korea 's nuclear program are complex .
He indicated that differences in opinion would naturally emerge from talks involving several parties .
In an interview earlier Thursday , South Korean Unification Minister Chung Dong-young said Pyongyang has a general right to pursue a civilian nuclear program .
Washington is firmly opposed to Pyongyang having any nuclear facilities whatsoever .
The six-party talks - involving China , Japan , Russia , the United States and the two Koreas - recessed Sunday after 13 days .

Senator John Kerry and former Senator John Edwards , Democratic running mates in the 2004 Presidential election , have lambasted President Bush for his response to Hurricane Katrina .
Senator Kerry of Massachusetts , the Democratic nominee for President in 2004 , told a university audience Monday that Katrina has exposed a broader pattern of ' incompetence and negligence ' in the Bush administration .
The Republican National Committee responded to Senator Kerry 's speech by saying the efforts to politicize the tragedy are ' unsavory ' .

The United Nations World Food Program ( WFP ) says Burma 's military government has placed restrictions on food deliveries as it cracks down on mass protests throughout the country .
The U.N. agency on Friday expressed concern that the government 's actions could block efforts to feed some 5,00,000 people in the impoverished Southeast Asian country .
According to the agency , Burmese authorities have stopped all movement of food out of the country 's second-largest city , Mandalay , which will affect deliveries in northern Shan State .
Unrest also has stopped food delivery in the port city of Sittwe , disrupting the World Food Program 's operations in north Rakhine State .

Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulija Tymoshenko says she is breaking with President Viktor Yushchenko following his decision to dismiss her government .
Ms. Tymoshenko said Friday she is no longer a member of Mr. Yushchenko 's political team , but stopped short of calling herself an opponent .
The former prime minister said she and her followers plan to run for office separately in next year 's parliamentary elections .
Mr. Yushchenko dismissed the government Thursday , amid allegations of corruption and reports of infighting between the prime minister and Petro Poroshenko , another senior official .
The president has named senior regional official Yuri Yekhanurov prime minister .
Ms. Tymoshenko was a key figure during Ukraine 's Orange Revolution that swept the president into power last year .
She blamed presidential advisors , rather than Mr. Yushchenko himself , for her firing .
Ivory Coast has reported its first outbreaks of the deadly H5N1 strain of birdflu .
The Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health says tests have confirmed the presence of the virus in birds from two outbreaks in Abidjan .
The H5N1 strain was detected in seven chickens , nine ducks and one sparrowhawk .
The virus has been confirmed in five other African nations - Burkina Faso , Cameroon , Egypt , Niger and Nigeria .
Earlier this week , a minister from the southern African country of Malawi told a 19-nation bird flu conference that Africa is not prepared to fight bird flu .
A United Nations official at the same conference said poverty and inadequate medical and veterinary services make Africa vulnerable to the disease .
Bird flu has killed more than 113 people worldwide since 2003 , mostly in Asia .
Many members of Iraq 's national football ( soccer ) team were scheduled to leave Iraq Saturday - just one day after ceremonies honoring them for their win last week at the Asian Cup championship in Jakarta .
Some players have contracts with teams outside Iraq and live abroad .
The Iraqi team has not played at home for 17 years due to fears of violence since the start of the 2003 U.S. invasion and to international sanctions against Saddam Hussein 's regime before that .
The team practices in Jordan .
On Friday , Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki welcomed Iraq 's national team to celebrations in Baghdad 's heavily fortified Green Zone .
Most Baghdad residents were barred from the celebration because of security concerns .

EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said in Brussels Friday that the broadcast appeal could help open ' a new chapter ' for relations with Iran .
Solana also called Mr. Obama 's attempt to reach out to Iran constructive .
Like the United States , the EU accuses Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons and has imposed a series of sanctions on Tehran .
Last month , German Chancellor Angela Merkel threatened to impose additional sanctions on Iran if talks do not work .
New White House budget figures show a program to help seniors pay for prescription drugs will cost the government some $ 320 billion more than projected .
Figures released late Tuesday raised the estimate of the program 's cost to $ 720 billion over the next decade .
That is nearly twice the $ 400 billion estimate President Bush offered in 2003 , before Congress added the prescription drug benefit to the government 's Medicare medical insurance program .
The increased cost is likely to draw criticism from lawmakers concerned about the soaring U.S. budget deficit .
Speaking with reporters at the White House Wednesday , Mr. Bush said Medicare has ' unfunded liabilities ' that he and Congress will have to deal with after fixing the Social Security retirement program .
The United Nations says it has placed U.N. disaster teams around the world on alert and told them they are ready to be deployed to the U.S. Gulf Coast .
A U.N. spokesman in Geneva Friday said members of its U.N. Disaster Assessment and Coordination Center specializing in natural disasters are ready to help the United States deal with the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina , if requested by Washington .
He said the world body 's various agencies - including the World Health Organization , UNICEF , the World Food Program and the U.N. refugee agency - are meeting Friday in New York to put together an offer of logistical support .
The U.N. announcement comes several hours after Secretary-General Kofi Annan said America has always been generous in responding to disasters around the globe , and urged the international community to offer assistance to the devastated communities along the U.S. Gulf Coast .
Burmese officials have blamed local dissident student groups , working with western governments , for Friday 's bomb blast at a luxury hotel in Rangoon .
Officials held a rare news conference in the capital city Sunday to denounce the attack .
They released a statement that alleged several groups , including the All Burma Students Democratic Front , the Karen National Union , and the Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors were behind the small blast outside the Traders Hotel , that did little damage and caused no injuries .
The Burmese Information Minister Brigadier General Kyaw Hsann also said authorities had thwarted a separate major bomb attack .
Officials have not mentioned any arrests in the alleged bomb plots .
Burma 's tightly-guarded capital has seen a number of explosions in recent months .
The government regularly blames exile groups that oppose military rule .
Some dissidents say the blasts are carried out by government-linked groups to justify tighter security .
Activists from an alliance of five political parties in Nepal say they will hold a second round of protests Monday against King Gyanendra 's assumption of absolute power .
A spokesman for the alliance said Sunday the nationwide rallies will go ahead despite the king 's ban on demonstrations .
Last Tuesday , political parties organized street protests to pressure the king to restore democracy in Nepal .
Police arrested dozens of people , including former government ministers and former lawmakers .
Sunday , police in Kathmandu arrested three students for shouting anti-monarchy slogans .
King Gyanendra dismissed the government , imposed a state of emergency and suspended civil liberties on February 1 .
He said his move was prompted by the government 's failure to contain a Maoist rebellion , which has killed thousands of people since 1996 .
NATO says two civilians have been killed and at least 10 others wounded in a fuel truck explosion in eastern Afghanistan .
A NATO statement says Thursday 's blast in Nangarhar province also damaged nearby shops and vehicles , and that the explosion was likely triggered by an improvised explosive device .
In neighboring Logar province , NATO says coalition forces killed 12 Taliban insurgents , including a commander during an operation on Wednesday .
Another three insurgents were killed while Afghan and coalition forces were pursuing commanders of the insurgent group Jama'at ul Dawa al-Qu'ran in northeastern Kunar province .
The group is linked to attacks that killed two U.S. service members .
And the alliance says eight coalition members were injured Thursday after a NATO helicopter made a hard landing in southern Kandahar province .
NATO says based on initial reports , the incident was not a result of enemy fire .
Colombian authorities say they have dismantled a FALSE passport ring with links to al-Qaida and the Islamic militant group Hamas , and arrested 19 people in connection with the case .
Prosecutors said Thursday three members of the state intelligence agency known as DAS , were among those arrested , and that one of them is among eight people sought by the United States for extradition .
Officials also say a member of Colombia 's National Registry , which provides official identification documents , was arrested in the sweep .
Authorities say the arrests follow an investigation that began in 2002 .
Local media reports say the passport-forging ring enabled foreign nationals to travel as Colombians to Europe and the United States .
The reports say the suspects sent the forged passports to citizens of Pakistan , Jordan , Iraq and Egypt , who never actually set foot in Colombia .
Palestinian witnesses say Israeli troops shot and killed two Palestinian civilians in separate incidents in the West Bank and Gaza Strip Tuesday .
They say soldiers shot dead a Palestinian bystander during a clash with militants in Nablus .

Israeli forces regularly mount raids into West Bank towns to arrest wanted Palestinians .
In the Gaza Strip , witnesses say a Palestinian farmer was killed when Israeli forces fired tank or artillery shells into the territory .
Members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee say confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers will begin November 7 .
The announcement Wednesday comes a little more than two weeks after President Bush nominated Ms. Miers to take over the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor .
Mr. Bush has drawn fire from fellow Republicans for the nomination of Ms. Miers , the current White House Counsel .
Some want the president to withdraw her nomination and pick a known conservative who would decisively shift the high court to the right .
Ms. Miers has not made her positions on contentious issues like abortion and gay marriage publicly known since her nomination .
Indian search teams have recovered at least 50 bodies in the eastern state of West Bengal where an overcrowded ferry capsized .
Officials say more than 100 people were on the ferry when it overturned Saturday in a turbulent river near the Bay of Bengal .
Dozens of passengers have been rescued , but others are still missing .
Officials say most of the passengers were Muslims returning to the town of Kakdwip after attending a religious festival .
Authorities say the boat 's maximum capacity was 60 people .
Boating accidents are common in India , where vessels are often overloaded and safety standards are poor .
Iraqi authorities say a suicide bomber killed four policemen in Baghdad and gunmen killed at least 11 other Iraqis in another town Thursday .

The chief of the Polisario rebels in Western Sahara has asked the African Union for help securing the release of prisoners held by Morocco .
According to Algeria 's APS news agency , Mohamed Abdelaziz , secretary-general of the Polisario Front , wrote to the current chairman of the African Union , Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo , asking him to intercede with Morocco .
Mr. Abdelaziz said it was unfair that Morocco was still holding the prisoners , even after the Polisario Front released hundreds of Moroccan soldiers this month .
The letter said Morocco was holding 37 political prisoners and 151 prisoners of war .
It said that some 500 people were missing .
Rebels battled Moroccan troops over control of Western Sahara for 16 years , following the withdrawal of colonial power Spain .
In 1991 , the United Nations brokered a cease-fire to end fighting .

He is Bolivia 's first ethnically indigenous president .
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has urged international donors to keep aid flowing following last week 's election victory by the militant group Hamas .
Mr. Abbas , who is not a member of Hamas , says the Palestinians will stick to their agreements with Israel .
He spoke alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel after talks Monday in Ramallah .
Ms. Merkel stressed her previous demand that Hamas renounce violence and accept Israel 's right to exist .
EU foreign ministers say Hamas must take those two steps to ensure aid is not suspended .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice made a similar demand Sunday .
In London , members of the so-called Middle East quartet - the U.S. , Russia , the EU and the United Nations - are meeting for talks on how to deal with a Hamas-led Palestinian government .
Burma 's state media are hailing the capture of a rare , white elephant as a sign the country will enjoy peace , stability and prosperity under a new , elected government , as the media say it does under present military rule .
The official New Light of Myanmar newspaper said Saturday that the elephant , captured Thursday in western Rakhine state , is a source of national pride .
The paper said the pachyderm is estimated to be 18 years old and is the fifth white elephant captured since 2001 .
Burma has been under harsh military rule since 1962 and elections scheduled for November have been widely criticized by the international community as a sham to keep the military in power .
Police in Mauritania say security forces have arrested the leaders of a terrorist cell with alleged links to al-Qaida .
The detainees are said to be prominent leaders in the guerrilla group , Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat .
A statement from the national police says seven people were arrested earlier this week as they returned from the group 's training camp in Algeria .
The detainees are said to be among a total of 20 guerrillas who were sent to the camp for training .
A top U.S. general says the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is presenting challenges to the U.S. ability to advance its interests in the Middle East .
General David Petraeus , head of the U.S. Central Command , says the conflict foments anti-American sentiment in the region due to a perception of U.S. favoritism toward Israel .
The U.S. Central Command oversees American forces in the Middle East and Central Asia .
Petraeus 's comments to a Senate committee Tuesday came amid a U.S.-Israeli dispute about Israel 's plan to build 1,600 more housing units in disputed East Jerusalem .
Peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians have been stalled for more than a year primarily because of the construction of Jewish settlements .
World oil prices hit record highs for the fifth day in a row Friday .
The price of crude oil for future delivery reached $ 66.15 a barrel in New York trading .
Prices are up six percent this week and have more than doubled since the end of 2003 .
Analysts blame the latest increases on strong demand for oil , a spate of refinery problems , and worries that Middle East tensions could crimp crude oil supplies .
Soaring prices for imported oil also boosted the U.S. trade deficit six percent in June .
Friday 's report from the Commerce Department says the gap between what Americans sell abroad and what they buy reached $ 58.8 billion .
The politically sensitive U.S. trade deficit with China rose to a record $ 17.6 billion .
Colombia 's former president , Andres Pastrana , has been named the country 's next ambassador to the United States .
Mr. Pastrana , a lawyer and former television journalist , is replacing Luis Alberto Moreno .
Mr. Pastrana led Colombia from 1998 to 2002 , but has spent the past several years living in Spain .
His main objectives as ambassador to the United States will include promoting ' Plan Colombia ' - a U.S. sponsored anti-cocaine initiative .
Over the past three years , the United States has spent more than $ 3 billion to help eradicate coca production in Colombia .
Critics of the plan say it has done little to combat drug trafficking or stem Colombia 's drug-fueled civil war .
The United Nations Human Rights Council has ordered a commission of inquiry to investigate alleged abuses by Israel in its campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon .
Council members Friday voted 27-Nov in support of the inquiry at a special session in Geneva .
The 57-member Organization of the Islamic Conference requested the session and proposed the resolution that singled out Israel for condemnation and avoided any criticism of Hezbollah .
Earlier Friday , the U.N. human rights chief urged the Council to take account of Hezbollah 's actions - in addition to Israel .
Louise Arbour said Israeli attacks affecting civilians continue unabated , but she also deplored Hezbollah 's ' indiscriminate shelling of densely populated centers in northern Israel . '
And she noted repeated allegations of Hezbollah 's use of human shields .
Western Sahara has a small market-based economy whose main industries are fishing , phosphate mining , and pastoral nomadism .
The territory 's arid desert climate makes sedentary agriculture difficult , and Western Sahara imports much of its food .
The Moroccan Government administers Western Sahara 's economy and is a source of employment , infrastructure development , and social spending in the territory .
Western Sahara 's unresolved legal status makes the exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between Morocco and the Polisario .
Morocco and the EU in July 2006 signed a four-year agreement allowing European vessels to fish off the coast of Morocco , including the disputed waters off the coast of Western Sahara .
Oil has never been found in Western Sahara in commercially significant quantities , but Morocco and the Polisario have quarreled over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration in the territory .
Western Sahara 's main long-term economic challenge is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of providing greater employment and income to the territory .
Since 1962 , when France stationed military personnel in the region , French Polynesia has changed from a subsistence agricultural economy to one in which a high proportion of the work force is either employed by the military or supports the tourist industry .
With the halt of French nuclear testing in 1996 , the military contribution to the economy fell sharply .
Tourism accounts for about one-fourth of GDP and is a primary source of hard currency earnings .
Other sources of income are pearl farming and deep-sea commercial fishing .
The small manufacturing sector primarily processes agricultural products .
The territory benefits substantially from development agreements with France aimed principally at creating new businesses and strengthening social services .
Argentina benefits from rich natural resources , a highly literate population , an export-oriented agricultural sector , and a diversified industrial base .
Although one of the world 's wealthiest countries 100 years ago , Argentina suffered during most of the 20th century from recurring economic crises , persistent fiscal and current account deficits , high inflation , mounting external debt , and capital flight .
A severe depression , growing public and external indebtedness , and a bank run culminated in 2001 in the most serious economic , social , and political crisis in the country 's turbulent history .
Interim President Adolfo RODRIGUEZ SAA declared a default - the largest in history - on the government 's foreign debt in December of that year , and abruptly resigned only a few days after taking office .
His successor , Eduardo DUHALDE , announced an end to the peso 's decade-long 1-to-1 peg to the US dollar in early 2002 .
The economy bottomed out that year , with real GDP 18 % smaller than in 1998 and almost 60 % of Argentines under the poverty line .
Real GDP rebounded to grow by an average 8.5 % annually over the subsequent six years , taking advantage of previously idled industrial capacity and labor , an audacious debt restructuring and reduced debt burden , excellent international financial conditions , and expansionary monetary and fiscal policies .
Inflation also increased , however , during the administration of President Nestor KIRCHNER , which responded with price restraints on businesses , as well as export taxes and restraints , and beginning in early 2007 , with understating inflation data .
Cristina FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER succeeded her husband as President in late 2007 , and the rapid economic growth of previous years began to slow sharply the following year as government policies held back exports and the world economy fell into recession .
The economy has rebounded strongly from the 2009 recession , but the government 's continued reliance on expansionary fiscal and monetary policies risks exacerbating already high inflation .
The Dominican economy has been dependent on agriculture - primarily bananas - in years past , but increasingly has been driven by tourism as the government seeks to promote Dominica as an ' ecotourism ' destination .
In order to diversify the island 's production base , the government also is attempting to develop an offshore financial sector and has signed an agreement with the EU to develop geothermal energy resources .
In 2003 , the government began a comprehensive restructuring of the economy - including elimination of price controls , privatization of the state banana company , and tax increases - to address an economic and financial crisis and to meet IMF requirements .
This restructuring paved the way for an economic recovery - real growth for 2006 reached a two-decade high - and helped to reduce the debt burden , which remains at about 85 % of GDP .
Hurricane Dean struck the island in August 2007 causing damages equivalent to 20 % of GDP .
In 2009 , growth slowed as a result of the global recession ; it picked up only slightly in 2010 .
Burundi is a landlocked , resource-poor country with an underdeveloped manufacturing sector .
The economy is predominantly agricultural which accounts for just over 30 % of GDP and employs more than 90 % of the population .
Burundi 's primary exports are coffee and tea , which account for 90 % of foreign exchange earnings , though exports are a relatively small share of GDP .
Burundi 's export earnings - and its ability to pay for imports - rests primarily on weather conditions and international coffee and tea prices .
The Tutsi minority , 14 % of the population , dominates the coffee trade .
An ethnic-based war that lasted for over a decade resulted in more than 2,00,000 deaths , forced more than 48,000 refugees into Tanzania , and displaced 1,40,000 others internally .
Only one in two children go to school , and approximately one in 15 adults has HIV / AIDS .
Food , medicine , and electricity remain in short supply .
Less than 2 % of the population has electricity in its homes .
Burundi 's GDP grew around 4 % annually in 2006 - 10 .
Political stability and the end of the civil war have improved aid flows and economic activity has increased , but underlying weaknesses - a high poverty rate , poor education rates , a weak legal system , a poor transportation network , overburdened utilities , and low administrative capacity - risk undermining planned economic reforms .
The purchasing power of most Burundians has decreased as wage increases have not kept up with inflation .
Burundi will continue to remain heavily dependent on aid from bilateral and multilateral donors ; the delay of funds after a corruption scandal cut off bilateral aid in 2007 reduced government 's revenues and its ability to pay salaries .
Burundi joined the East African Community , which should boost Burundi 's regional trade ties , and received $ 700 million in debt relief in 2009 .
Government corruption is also hindering the development of a healthy private sector as companies seek to navigate an environment with ever-changing rules .
A TRAVELER hired an Ass to convey him to a distant place .
The day being intensely hot , and the sun shining in its strength , the Traveler stopped to rest , and sought shelter from the heat under the Shadow of the Ass .
As this afforded only protection for one , and as the Traveler and the owner of the Ass both claimed it , a violent dispute arose between them as to which of them had the right to the Shadow .
The owner maintained that he had let the Ass only , and not his Shadow .
The Traveler asserted that he had , with the hire of the Ass , hired his Shadow also .
The quarrel proceeded from words to blows , and while the men fought , the Ass galloped off .
In quarreling about the shadow we often lose the substance .
A FLEA settled upon the bare foot of a Wrestler and bit him , causing the man to call loudly upon Hercules for help .
When the Flea a second time hopped upon his foot , he groaned and said , ' O Hercules ! if you will not help me against a Flea , how can I hope for your assistance against greater antagonists ? '
In the old days , when men were allowed to have many wives , a middle-aged Man had one wife that was old and one that was young ; each loved him very much , and desired to see him like herself .
Now the Man 's hair was turning grey , which the young Wife did not like , as it made him look too old for her husband .
So every night she used to comb his hair and pick out the white ones .
But the elder Wife saw her husband growing grey with great pleasure , for she did not like to be mistaken for his mother .
So every morning she used to arrange his hair and pick out as many of the black ones as she could .
The consequence was the Man soon found himself entirely bald .
Yield to all and you will soon have nothing to yield .
Russian President Vladimir Putin says he is optimistic a deal with Iran on its controversial nuclear program can be reached .
During a visit to Hungary Tuesday , Mr. Putin said it is quite possible to reach agreement on Moscow 's proposal to enrich uranium on Russian soil for Iran 's nuclear energy needs .
Iran has said it agrees in principle to the deal .
But it is unclear if it would also agree to stop domestic uranium enrichment - a demand of Russia and the West .
A Japanese official Tuesday quoted Iran 's visiting Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki as saying that the Russian plan would be a bridge between Iran 's right to peaceful nuclear energy and global trust in Tehran .
The United States and European Union say Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons - a charge it denies .
An international media group says it is disturbed by the recent arrests of two television broadcasters by Afghan authorities .
Reporters Without Borders says Fahim Kohdamani of Emroz TV and Ajmal Alamzai of Ariana TV were arrested on Monday for airing programs deemed anti-Islamic and for speaking with Taliban representatives .
It says Kohdamani was arrested for broadcasting music and hosting an entertainment program .
In a statement Tuesday , the group says his arrest appeared to be linked to a letter of complaint sent to President Hamid Karzai by Muslim clerics .
Alamzai , the host of Ariana TV 's program ' Didadgah , ' was detained for speaking with a Taliban member during a program that discussed U.S. efforts to reach out to moderate Islamic insurgents .
The statement says he was released late Monday evening .
North Korea says it will not dismantle its nuclear program before any new talks aimed at eliminating its access to nuclear weapons .
The commentary in the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper also says Pyongyang has neither opposed nor shunned the six-party talks on its nuclear ambitions .
The newspaper comments come amid renewed speculation that a new round of negotiations could begin within the next few weeks .
Three rounds of talks have been held in Beijing , but a fourth session scheduled for June , 2004 failed to take place because North Korea boycotted the process over what it called a hostile U.S. attitude .
But earlier this month , North Korean leader Kim Jong-il said the talks could resume as early as July .
Authorities in Haiti say gunmen shot and killed two police officers and a civilian Monday in an apparent ambush in Port-au-Prince .
Police say gunman attacked the car the officers and civilian were driving in .
The shooting follows several weeks of attacks that officials say are aimed at destabilizing the country ahead of elections scheduled for later this year .
The United Nations mission and Haitian police have struggled to restore order to Haiti for more than a year , after an armed uprising ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide .
A U.S. Congressional investigation into Hurricane Katrina blames failures at all levels of government for the suffering and loss of life that resulted from last August 's storm .
U.S. news organizations have published parts of a draft of the final document that is to be presented Wenesday to Congress .
The report says the federal government 's response to Katrina was marked by ineffectiveness and organizational paralysis .
It also faulted local and state officials in Louisiana for delaying mandatory evacuations .
The report notes that problems first noted after the September 11 terrorist attacks - such as the inability of first responders to communicate with each - were again problems during the Katrina response .
Democrats , who wanted an independent probe , boycotted the investigation carried out by Republican members of the House of Representatives .
Egypt says it will not ratify a key treaty banning nuclear tests unless Israel first signs a separate agreement calling for a halt to the spread of atomic bombs .
In Cairo Friday , Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit linked Egyptian ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty to Israeli acceptance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty , or NPT .
Mr. Gheit said the refusal of Israel to sign the non-proliferation accord is a threat to the stability of the entire Middle East .
All Middle Eastern countries except Israel have signed the NPT , which aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons .
Israel and Egypt have both signed the other treaty banning nuclear tests , but neither nation has ratified it .
Israel has not officially stated that it has nuclear weapons , but it is widely believed to have about 200 nuclear warheads .
Security in Nepal 's capital remained tight Sunday , as police searched an area south of Kathmandu for rebels who launched a deadly pre-dawn attack on government troops .
The military says 17 rebels and at least six security personnel were killed in the fighting , which came as opponents of King Gyanendra 's direct rule continued to defy a government crackdown .
Elsewhere , authorities say suspected rebels shot dead a candidate for local office in the southern town of Janakpur .
The victim was identified as the local leader of a party that supports King Gyanendra .
Authorities say at least 30 protesters were arrested in the capital Sunday .
However , the royal government released former Prime Minister Gijira Prasad Koirala and several other leaders placed under house arrest last week .
Nepal 's main political parties vowed to continue the protests and called for a nationwide strike on Thursday .
The U.S. banking industry lost more than $ 26 billion in the last three months of 2008 , the first quarterly loss in 18 years .
The number of banks that regulators classify as ' troubled ' rose nearly 50 percent during the same quarter .
Banks lost money as the recession made it harder for borrowers to repay loans .
Banks were also hurt by losses on their investments in stocks and other areas .
The U.S. government 's Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation says the number of banks that actually fail is growing , with 25 going under last year .
Although the weak economy has resulted in increased losses for banks , the American Bankers Association said Thursday 97 percent of all the country 's banks are still rated ' well capitalized ' - meaning they have a significant financial buffer against losses .
There are more than 8,000 banks in the United States insured by the FDIC .
The Afghan government has welcomed the extradition of 14 Taleban insurgents from Pakistan to Kabul , but also urged its neighbor to hunt down more suspected militants hiding in Pakistan .
A government spokesman says such moves will strengthen relations between the two countries and will open a new era of cooperation in the war against terrorism .
Among those extradited were purported Taleban spokesmen Latif Hakimi and Mohammad Yasir .
Afghan state television showed Afghan soldiers leading the 14 men , all blindfolded , off a military plane late Wednesday .
Afghan officials say they will be put on trial for their role in violence against government targets , as well as Afghan and coalition forces .
Meanwhile , a bomb attached to a bicycle blew up Thursday , in the southern city of Kandahar , killing a policeman and wounding two civilians .
Lebanese officials say rescuers have recovered two bodies from the waters off Lebanon 's northern coast where a cargo ship carrying 83 crew members and livestock sank late Thursday .
The officials say Lebanese navy boats and United Nations vessels participating in the rescue mission also pulled at least 25 people from the rough Mediterranean waters .
Local authorities say the Panamanian-flagged vessel , carrying livestock from Uruguay to the Syrian port of Tartous , capsized some 17 kilometers off the Lebanese port of Tripoli in a heavy rainstorm .
They say the crew sent a distress call but the vessel sank before the rescue ships could reach the area .
Thursday 's accident came less than a week after a Togolese-flagged cargo ship with 12 crew on board sank off the Lebanese coast .
Six crew members were rescued but the rest remain missing .
Courtney Love plans to sell most of the items which once belonged to her husband , former Nirvana leader Kurt Cobain .
Comparing her house to a ' mausoleum , ' the 42-year-old rock singer says she plans to hold a charity auction .
Love and Cobain wed in 1992 and later that year had a daughter , Frances Bean .

AOL publicist Kurt Patat gave no date for the auction .
U.S. troops have killed eight insurgents in western Iraq , as military officials dispute claims that militants have kidnapped two U.S. Marines .
About one thousand U.S. troops launched the offensive near the Syrian border , in the latest attempt to drive insurgents from the area .
Residents said the operation appeared to be widening Sunday to several nearby towns .
Meanwhile , U.S. officials said they had no reason to believe an alleged statement from al Qaida in Iraq claiming to have kidnapped two Marines involved in the military offensive .
In a statement , U.S. officials said they were conducting checks to verify that all Marines were accounted for .
An Islamist web site carried the kidnapping claim , which demanded the release of female Sunni Muslim prisoners .
In Baghdad , militants freed the brother of Interior Minister Bayan Jabor , who was kidnapped one day earlier near the Sadr City district .

The Arabic language television network al-Jazeera Thursday broadcast what it said is a videotape of one of the bombers , Mohammad Sidique Khan , made just before the attack .
On the video , he blames the bombings on British support for the war in Iraq and what he calls atrocities against Muslims .
British officials say four suicide bombers were killed in the July 7 attacks .
An attempted bombing two weeks later failed .
It is still not clear if there is a direct tie between the two attacks .
The videotape also included comments from al-Qaida 's second-in-command , Ayman al-Zawahiri .
He warned that British Prime Minster Tony Blair 's policies would bring more destruction to the British people .
The British Foreign Office said it will not comment on any aspects of the tape .

Pakistani Foreign Minister Khurshid Kasuri made the comment after Tuesday 's meeting with his Iranian counterpart , Kamal Kharrazi , in Islamabad .
Iran proposed the pipeline in 1996 .
But New Delhi 's response has been lukewarm given its troubled relations with Islamabad and concerns about the safety of the pipeline carrying its energy supplies through Pakistani territory .
Mr. Kharrazi 's visit came as India and Pakistan concluded another round of slow-moving peace talks .
The Iranian foreign minister met with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf late Monday .
Before leaving Pakistan , Mr. Kharrazi held talks with Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz .

Scientists are hailing the results of a new study that shows a drug already used to treat advanced cancer has proven extremely effective against an aggressive form of early breast cancer .
In an article published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine , researchers found the drug Herceptin can prevent 50 percent of all breast tumors from recurring in patients with early stages of the disease .
The drug , which targets only diseased cells , only works for the estimated 20-percent of breast cancer cases in which tumors produce too much of a protein known as HER-2 .
Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer among women in the United States .
More than 2,00,000 American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer , and about 40,000 women will die of the disease in the United States in 2005 .
Officials say Herceptin will be marketed internationally by the Swiss drugmaker Roche .

Pope Benedict XVI says science has narrowed humanity 's understanding of the origins of life and that the theory of evolution can neither be proven or dismissed .
The pope 's extended views on evolution are appearing in print for the first time as part of a newly published German book called Creation and Evolution .
He writes that evolution can never be known for sure because it is impossible to conduct controlled laboratory experiments into the theory .
But Benedict does not give a 100 percent endorsement of creationism or intelligent design , saying the debate must be philosophical and go beyond science .
Advocates of intelligent design say life on Earth is too complex to have evolved randomly and must be the product of a higher power .

China has imposed a massive news blackout on the deadly police suppression of a village protest in Dongzhou earlier this month .
China 's state controlled media have been nearly silent about the December 6 incident in which activists say some 20 people were shot dead by police while protesting against a local power plant .
The only official news coverage has alleged that three civilians were killed and several injured after protesters attacked police , forcing officers to respond .
The news blackout extends to the Internet , where reporters say sophisticated filtering has blocked foreign news stories and prevented search engines , such as Google , from looking for keywords associated with the shootings .
But media rights group Reporters without Borders says some Internet users have successfully published messages about the incident in chat rooms by alluding to the shootings without mentioning specifics .
Chinese officials are reporting a new outbreak of bird flu in poultry - this time in northern China .

Nearly 70 people have died of bird flu in Asia since 2003 .
The Iraqi prime minister 's office says the journalist who threw his shoes at U.S. President George Bush has apologized .
A spokesman for Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said Thursday that reporter Muntazer al-Zaidi wrote a letter in which he asked for Mr. Maliki 's pardon , calling his display an ' ugly act . '
Relatives of Zaidi immediately cast doubt that he would write such a letter of his own accord .
The reporter has been in custody since the incident Sunday .
He faces up to 15 years in prison , depending on what charges will be made against him and if he is found guilty .
Thousands of Iraqis have protested in the streets , demanding his release .

The White House has yet to comment on a published report that the National Security Agency conducted broader surveillance of e-mails and telephone conversations without court orders than the administration has acknowledged .
Current and former government officials told The New York Times the NSA accessed domestic and international communications with help from telecommunication companies .
The newspaper says the companies have been storing information on calling patterns since the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States .
NSA officials were reported to have been studying the information in hope of finding terrorists .
The Bush administration has been under increased scrutiny from the public and many lawmakers for authorizing without court orders the surveillance of what the government says are only international calls and e-mails to and from the United States .
Vice President Dick Cheney says the Bush administration has all the legal authority it needs to wiretap phone calls and e-mails between U.S. citizens and persons abroad suspected of links to terrorism .
Cheney was asked on a national U.S. television show PBSNewshour Tuesday if the president would be willing to work with Congress to settle some of the disputes about the legality of the secret surveillance program .
He expressed concern that the legislative process could lead to the disclosure of sensitive operational matters .
Meanwhile , a Republican member of Congress has called for a full congressional investigation into the wiretapping program .

Reports say the 31-year-old patient in the town of Shenzhen developed fever and pneumonia-like symptoms June 3 .
Earlier Thursday , the World Health Organization confirmed that a seven-year-old Indonesian girl who died last month was infected with bird flu .
That means 38 people in Indonesia have now died of bird flu .
Avian flu has killed more than 125 people around the world since late 2003 .
Most of the victims have been in Asia .

Despite Mr. Zelaya 's statements , envoys from the two sides say negotiations will continue .
Mr. Micheletti has been under intense international pressure to restore Mr. Zelaya .
The deposed president 's opponents say he was ousted because he was trying to illegally change the constitution to extend his term in office .

By that measure , prices rose a modest two-tenths of a percent .
Energy prices soared earlier this year because of hurricane damage .
A separate report says the number of people who lost jobs because of Hurricanes Katrina , Rita , and Wilma now exceeds $ 6,00,000 .

The State Department and the Department of Homeland Security have submitted Tuesday a proposal for public comment .
The plan calls for a card that is small enough to fit into a person 's wallet .
It would meet the same standards as a traditional passport book , but would only be used by U.S. citizens traveling from the U.S. to Canada , Mexico , the Caribbean and Bermuda .
The proposed card would use radio frequency identification ( RFID ) that links the card to a government database that contains biographical information and a photograph .
The State Department says the passport card could make frequent travel easier for people who live in border communities .

The three-judge panel made the decision Tuesday , in an effort to speed up the Milosevic trial .
It previously had suggested a division , amid growing concerns about the former Yugoslav president 's poor health , which has repeatedly delayed the proceedings .
The court also adjourned the trial until January 23 , ahead of a planned Christmas break , giving Mr. Milosevic an additional three weeks to rest .
It rejected Mr. Milosevic 's request for extra time to present his defense , and it criticized him for focusing most of his time on Kosovo in efforts to force the court to give him the extension .
Mr. Milosevic faces more than 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s .

Russia and Ukraine say they have reached a final agreement on natural gas deliveries for the rest of the year .
Russia 's state-run gas monopoly Gazprom says the deal , announced Thursday , also specifies prices for gas delivered in the first two months of this year .
Additionally , the new agreement streamlines gas trade by eliminating intermediary companies that Ukraine said were complicating gas payment procedures .
Gazprom cut gas deliveries to Ukraine by more than 50 percent earlier this month , because , it said , no payment provisions were in place for gas delivered to Ukraine in January and February .
The Russian company had demanded $ 600 million in back payments , as well as for a payment plan for the rest of the year .
Ukraine threatened to siphon gas meant for Europe from pipelines that cross Ukraine .
The Israeli military says Israeli and Palestinian officials have agreed to meet for a second time Wednesday to resolve a standoff on handing over security of the West Bank town of Jericho .
Talks earlier Wednesday on transferring control of the towns of Jericho and Tulkarem broke down without an agreement .
Palestinian officials said the biggest obstacle is whether Israel will agree to remove the main checkpoint at the entrance of Jericho .
The Israeli pullback was agreed to at a Palestinian-Israeli summit last month in Egypt , but has been delayed because of a Palestinian suicide bombing 12 days ago in Tel Aviv that killed four people .
The transfer would be the first of several planned Israeli pullouts from five towns in the West Bank , including Qalqilya , Bethlehem and Ramallah .
French authorities are holding five men on suspicion of links to the al-Qaida affiliated terrorist group behind the deadly bombings in Algeria last week .
Officials say the five are part of a group of eight detained in Paris and the northwestern region of Rouen Tuesday .

A report by the European Union says Muslims across Europe are confronting a rise in discrimination and so-called ' Islamophobia ' .
The study , released by the European Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia Monday , says manifestations of Islamophobia range from verbal threats to physical attacks on people and property .
The report finds that European Muslims are disproportionally represented in areas with poor housing conditions .
It says their education levels are below average and their unemployment rates are higher than average .
Muslims are also found to be overrepresented in low-paying jobs and those that require few qualifications .
The study says the extent of discrimination and Islamophobic incidents against European Muslims remains underdocumented and underreported .
Muslims constitute about 3.5 percent of the population of the 25-nation bloc .
The International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran has produced a gas needed for uranium enrichment .
A former U.N. weapons inspector says Iran has produced enough of this nuclear material to fuel an atomic weapon .
The agency 's findings are part of a confidential report obtained by news agencies Friday .
The U.N. nuclear watchdog said Iran 's nuclear plant in Isfahan has processed about seven tons of uranium hexaflouride gas since resuming work in early August .
That gas can be turned into the key ingredient for a nuclear bomb .
The report said even after two years of U.N. investigation , Iran failed to answer important questions about its secret nuclear activity .
Iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , but critics fear Tehran is secretly working on nuclear weapons .
The International Committee of the Red Cross says rebels from Western Sahara have freed their last Moroccan prisoners of war .
Rebels from the Polisario Front handed over the 404 soldiers Thursday in the southern Algerian town of Tindouf .
They had held many of the Moroccans for two decades .
The rebels said they hoped the release would help clear the way for a peace settlement for Western Sahara .
They also urged Morocco to release any remaining rebel prisoners .
The Red Cross says Thursday 's release follows U.S. mediation .
A senior U.S. senator , Richard Lugar , arrived in Algeria Thursday to monitor the release .
The Polisario Front captured some 2,000 Moroccan troops in its 16-year war with Morocco over the desert territory .
The conflict began when Spain pulled out of the territory in 1975 .
A cease-fire was reached in 1991 .

A pro-Kurdish news agency says Kurdish rebels have extended their unilateral ceasefire with Turkey for two more weeks .
Their original 30-day truce expired on Tuesday .
The notice was published Wednesday by the Mesopotamia news agency , which frequently carries rebel statements .
This ceasefire extension by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party , known as the PKK , appears timed to coincide with the October 3 start of Turkey 's membership talks with the European Union .
The Associated Press quotes rebels who urged the Turkish government to correctly assess the historic opportunity for peace .
Turkey has repeatedly said it will not enter into direct talks with the PKK .
In announcing the ceasefire last month , the PKK said it would not conduct any operations beyond self-defense .
But Western news reports say rebels clashed twice last week with Turkish soldiers in southeastern Turkey .
Five soldiers were reported killed in the fighting .
Top Israeli and Palestinian security officials are meeting to work out a deal for Israel to hand over security control of several West Bank towns to the Palestinian Authority .
Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz and Palestinian Mohammed Dahlan began their talks hours after Palestinians say Israeli military gunfire killed a schoolgirl in the Gaza Strip .
Israel is probing the Monday incident , which triggered Palestinian mortar fire into an Israeli settlement near the school where the girl died .
No Israeli casualties were reported .
A short time later , Hamas and other militant groups said they would stick to their pledge to stop attacks on Israelis if the Israeli army does not launch offensive operations .

Japanese officials say the deaths of hundreds of chickens in eastern Japan earlier this year may have been caused by a fresh outbreak of bird flu .
About 430 chickens died between March and May at a poultry farm in Ibaraki prefecture , north of Tokyo .
The farm keeps 25,000 chickens .
A government laboratory is conducting tests to confirm whether the deaths were caused by the virus .
Officials inspected the farm on Saturday , but found no abnormalities .
Japan suffered several outbreaks of bird flu last year .
No one in Japan has yet been infected by the H5N1 avian flu virus that has killed 38 Vietnamese , 12 Thais and four Cambodians since the latest epidemic began in 2003 .
The U.S. special envoy to Sudan , Andrew Natsios , has warned of what he calls a ' poisonous ' political atmosphere between Sudan 's government in the north and rebels in the south .
Natsios Saturday said the U.S. is deeply concerned about the health of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed in 2005 .
He made the comments as he wrapped up a 10-day visit to Sudan .
That agreement ended the two decade-long civil war between the government in Khartoum and southern rebels .
Both sides have been critical of each other over missed deadlines for implementing key parts of the accord .
The agreement makes both sides partners in resolving the conflict in Darfur .
But Natsios said implementation has been made difficult , in part , because both parties are facing one another in elections slated for 2009 .
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers says it has finished pumping water out of New Orleans , after the southern city flooded as a result of hurricanes Katrina and Rita .
A spokeswoman for the Corps made the announcement Tuesday after working for weeks to pump the water out at a rate of about 15 centimeters per day .
The Corps of Engineers is responsible for New Orleans ' levees and flood walls .
Most of the city is below sea level , and some 80 percent of it flooded after Katrina when water overflowed some flood walls and broke through others .
Some neighborhoods were inundated a second time when Rita brought heavy rains last month .
The Corps spokeswoman said the levees will be repaired to a pre-Katrina level of readiness by next June .
Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos has called on the United Nations to move from rhetoric to action when helping developing nations .
Mr. Papadopoulos told the U.N. General Assembly Thursday that the gap between what he calls the haves and the have-nots is widening dramatically .
He said the world body must honor past commitments and work to achieve goals for debt relief , improving access to world markets , and fighting AIDS and other diseases .
Mr. Papadopoulos said detecting the seeds of conflict early and preventing them from blowing up into war should be the cornerstone of U.N. collective security efforts .
Russian President Vladimir Putin says his government will only support proposals on the future of Serbia 's Kosovo province if they are acceptable to both Serbia and ethnic Albanians living in the province .
Mr. Putin spoke Sunday , in the Black Sea resort of Sochi , after talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
His comments came as U.N. envoys prepare to give the U.N. Security Council recommendations on the future of the province .
Ethnic Albanians , who comprise 90 percent of Kosovo 's population , are seeking independence - a push strongly opposed by Belgrade .
Negotiators are expected to present a compromise offering some form of provincial autonomy .
As a member of the Security Council , Russia - a historically close ally of Serbia - is likely to play a key role in Kosovo 's future , because it can use its Council veto to block any deal that does not satisfy Belgrade .
Officials from the International Security Assistance Force say a NATO soldier was killed Saturday during fighting in southern Afghanistan .
NATO officials say four others were wounded in the clash .

The famously hard-living Richards told NME that his survival was the result of luck , and he cautioned young musicians not to emulate him .
' I was number one on the ' who 's likely to die ' list for 10 years , ' he said .
' I mean , I was really disappointed when I fell off the list . '
The Islamic militant group Hamas says it has formed its cabinet and will present the choices to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Sunday .
Hamas , which won parliamentary elections in January , failed to get any other Palestinian faction to join the new government .
Hamas had planned to meet with Mr. Abbas Saturday .
There is no word on why the plans were changed .
Mr. Abbas 's Fatah Party has refused to join a Hamas-led government , saying the militant group must first renounce violence and accept past peace accords with Israel .

The minister 's convoy was hit as it traveled near the town of Balad , north of Baghdad .
Elsewhere , the U.S. military is releasing more than 400 Iraqi detainees including five women prisoners Thursday and Friday .
A military statement says a review of their cases determined there was no reason to keep holding them .
Iraqi and U.S. officials have stressed the move has nothing to do with American journalist Jill Carroll , who was kidnapped earlier this month .
Her kidnappers threatened to kill her by last Friday unless all Iraqi women detainees were released .
The deadline passed with no word on her fate .
Concerns about swine flu have been hurting industries as diverse as airlines and pork production , and boosted demand for the dollar and the yen .
Airlines that were already struggling with a recession that slashed demand must now cope with a sharp fall in travel to Mexico , a popular tourist destination .
Falling demand for jet fuel is putting downward pressure on oil prices .
And pork producers , and the farmers who grow grain to feed pigs , have also seen prices for their commodities drop sharply as some nations banned imports of pork from Mexico and some parts of the United States .
The ban , and the falling prices came even though health experts have said repeatedly that properly cooked pork does not transmit the flu .
Worried traders also sold the Mexican peso and some other currencies , and bought U.S. dollars and Japanese yen for their perceived safety in a crisis .
Israel 's highest court has upheld the government 's plan to withdraw from all of the Gaza Strip and four small West Bank settlements .
An 11-judge High Court panel ruled Thursday the pullout plan is legal and does not violate the human rights of Jewish settlers who opposed the move .
In a 10-Jan vote , the justices rejected 12 petitions challenging the withdrawal planned for August .
The sole dissenting justice , Edmund Levy , said the plan should be canceled .
Hours before the ruling , Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz and Palestinian Authority Interior Minister Nasser Youssef agreed to closely coordinate the pullout to prevent militants from taking over vacated areas .
Meanwhile , Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is in the Gaza Strip for talks with militants to preserve a four-month Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire threatened by two days of violence that has killed five people .

Mr. Talat will replace Rauf Denktash , who has led the Turkish Cypriot community for decades , but did not seek another term .
Chinese worker sews clothing at a garment factory in Beijing China is criticizing the European Union 's decision to investigate surging imports of Chinese textile products .
In a statement on its web site , the Chinese Commerce Ministry says the EU move runs counter to the spirit of free trade , and could have a negative impact on bilateral relations .
The EU is looking at Chinese textiles flooding into European markets since a worldwide quota system expired January 1 .
The EU says imports of some Chinese textile have risen as much as 500 percent since then .
The probe could lead the EU to impose limits those products .
The United States is also looking into the impact that increased Chinese textile imports is having on its textile producers .
The annual Smithsonian Kite Festival celebrated the art and history of Chinese kites at this year 's event .
Kites large and small ; kite fliers professional and amateur ; Washingtonians as well as visitors from around the world gathered around the Washington Monument to welcome the colorful designs .

Officials say about 100 houses were set ablaze in the fighting .
Bangladeshi authorities have imposed a ban on public gatherings in Khagrachhari to restore order .
The violence erupted after tribal activists from the United People 's Democratic Front blocked roads to protest the killing of two tribal people in clashes with Bengali settlers on Saturday .
Earlier clashes in the neighboring town of Baghaichhari also resulted in around 100 homes being torched and prompted the government to deploy troops .

Russia has extradited a Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect who was hiding in Siberia until authorities detained him last year .
The Bosnian State Court said Dragan Zelenovic was handed over late Thursday .
He is expected to appear before a judge later Friday .
The former policeman is wanted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague for atrocities committed against Bosnian Muslims in the eastern Foca region during Bosnia-Herzegovina 's 1992 - 95 war .

The U.S. government says BP has agreed to pay a record fine of more than $ 50 million for failing to correct problems at a Texas oil refinery that exploded and killed 15 workers in 2005 .
The company is still contesting about $ 30 million in other fines in connection with the fiery blast that injured 170 people .
U.S. regulators say they found hundreds of safety violations at the BP refinery when they inspected it in 2009 .
They also say the company failed to make promised changes and repairs at the refinery near Houston , Texas .
The 2005 refinery explosion is separate from this year 's environmental disaster that grew out of an explosion and fire on a BP oil drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico .
Poland has pursued a policy of economic liberalization since 1990 and today stands out as a success story among transition economies .
It is the only country in the European Union to maintain positive GDP growth through the 2008 - 2009 economic downturn .
GDP per capita is still much below the EU average , but is similar to that of the three Baltic states .
Since 2004 , EU membership and access to EU structural funds have provided a major boost to the economy .
Unemployment fell rapidly to 6.4 % in October 2008 , but climbed back to 11.8 % for the year 2010 , exceeding the EU average by more than 2 % .
Inflation reached a low of about 2.6 % in 2010 due to the global economic slowdown but has since climbed and is expected to remain around 3 % , and close to the upper limit of the National Bank of Poland 's target rate .
Poland 's economic performance could improve over the longer term if the country addresses some of the remaining deficiencies in its road and rail infrastructure and its business environment .
An inefficient commercial court system , a rigid labor code , bureaucratic red tape , burdensome tax system , and persistent low-level corruption keep the private sector from performing up to its full potential .
Rising demands to fund health care , education , and the state pension system caused the public sector budget deficit to rise to 7.9 % of GDP in 2010 .
The PO/PSL coalition government , which came to power in November 2007 , has planned to reduce the budget deficit in 2011 and has also announced its intention to enact business-friendly reforms , increase workforce participation , reduce public sector spending growth , lower taxes , and accelerate privatization .
The government has moved slowly on most major reforms , but has sped up privatization .
Half the population still depends on agriculture and livestock for a livelihood , even though many of the nomads and subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts in the 1970s and 1980s .
Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore , which account for nearly 40 % of total exports .
The nation 's coastal waters are among the richest fishing areas in the world but overexploitation by foreigners threatens this key source of revenue .
The country 's first deepwater port opened near Nouakchott in 1986 .
Before 2000 , drought and economic mismanagement resulted in a buildup of foreign debt .
In February 2000 , Mauritania qualified for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) initiative and nearly all of its foreign debt has since been forgiven .
A new investment code approved in December 2001 improved the opportunities for direct foreign investment .
Mauritania and the IMF agreed to a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility ( PRGF ) arrangement in 2006 .
Mauritania made satisfactory progress , but the IMF , World Bank , and other international actors suspended assistance and investment in Mauritania after the August 2008 coup .
Since the presidential election in July 2009 , donors have resumed assistance .
Oil prospects , while initially promising , have largely failed to materialize , and the government has placed a priority on attracting private investment to spur economic growth .
The Government also emphasizes reduction of poverty , improvement of health and education , and privatization of the economy .
Over the past 20 years the government has transformed New Zealand from an agrarian economy dependent on concessionary British market access to a more industrialized , free market economy that can compete globally .
This dynamic growth has boosted real incomes - but left behind some at the bottom of the ladder - and broadened and deepened the technological capabilities of the industrial sector .
Per capita income rose for ten consecutive years until 2007 in purchasing power parity terms , but fell in 2008 - 9 .
Debt-driven consumer spending drove robust growth in the first half of the decade , helping fuel a large balance of payments deficit that posed a challenge for economic managers .
Inflationary pressures caused the central bank to raise its key rate steadily from January 2004 until it was among the highest in the OECD in 2007 - 8 ; international capital inflows attracted to the high rates further strengthened the currency and housing market , however , aggravating the current account deficit .
The economy fell into recession before the start of the global financial crisis and contracted for five consecutive quarters in 2008 - 9 .
In line with global peers , the central bank cut interest rates aggressively and the government developed fiscal stimulus measures .
The economy posted a 1.7 % decline in 2009 , but pulled out of recession late in the year , and achieved 2.1 % growth in 2010 .
Nevertheless , key trade sectors remain vulnerable to weak external demand .
The government plans to raise productivity growth and develop infrastructure , while reining in government spending .
Independent from France in 1960 , Mauritania annexed the southern third of the former Spanish Sahara ( now Western Sahara ) in 1976 but relinquished it after three years of raids by the Polisario guerrilla front seeking independence for the territory .
Maaouya Ould Sid Ahmed TAYA seized power in a coup in 1984 and ruled Mauritania with a heavy hand for more than two decades .
A series of presidential elections that he held were widely seen as flawed .
A bloodless coup in August 2005 deposed President TAYA and ushered in a military council that oversaw a transition to democratic rule .
Independent candidate Sidi Ould Cheikh ABDALLAHI was inaugurated in April 2007 as Mauritania 's first freely and fairly elected president .
His term ended prematurely in August 2008 when a military junta led by General Mohamed Ould Abdel AZIZ deposed him and ushered in a military council government .
AZIZ was subsequently elected president in July 2009 and sworn in the following month .
The country continues to experience ethnic tensions among its black population ( Afro-Mauritanians ) and white and black Moor ( Arab-Berber ) communities , and is having to confront a growing terrorism threat by al-Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb ( AQIM ) .
A NUMBER of Flies were attracted to a jar of honey which had been overturned in a housekeeper 's room , and placing their feet in it , ate greedily .
Their feet , however , became so smeared with the honey that they could not use their wings , nor release themselves , and were suffocated .
Just as they were expiring , they exclaimed , ' O foolish creatures that we are , for the sake of a little pleasure we have destroyed ourselves . '
Pleasure bought with pains , hurts .
THE MONKEY , it is said , has two young ones at each birth .
The Mother fondles one and nurtures it with the greatest affection and care , but hates and neglects the other .
It happened once that the young one which was caressed and loved was smothered by the too great affection of the Mother , while the despised one was nurtured and reared in spite of the neglect to which it was exposed .
The best intentions will not always ensure success .
There 's nothing I like better than the sound of a banjo , unless of course it 's the sound of a chicken caught in a vacuum cleaner .

U.N. Sanctions chief Ellen Loj told reporters Saturday in Monrovia that Liberia has more work to do , but is working diligently to meet the conditions set for the lifting of the trade sanctions .
A ban on Liberian diamonds was imposed in 2001 by the U.N. Security Council after a British investigation found former Liberian President Charles Taylor was trading the diamonds for weapons for rebels in neighboring Sierra Leone .
The timber sanctions were imposed in 2003 when the Security Council said Taylor was using timber proceeds to fund war at home and in Sierra Leone .
Ellen Loj said the Security Council will meet in June to review the sanctions .

The economy of Saint Kitts and Nevis is heavily dependent upon tourism revenues , which has replaced sugar , the traditional mainstay of the economy until the 1970s .
Following the 2005 harvest , the government closed the sugar industry after decades of losses of 03-Apr % of GDP annually .
To compensate for employment losses , the government has embarked on a program to diversify the agricultural sector and to stimulate other sectors of the economy , such as tourism , export-oriented manufacturing , and offshore banking .
More than 2,00,000 tourists visited the islands in 2009 .
Like other tourist destinations in the Caribbean , St. Kitts and Nevis is vulnerable to damage from natural disasters and shifts in tourism demand .
The current government is constrained by one of the world 's highest public debt burdens equivalent to roughly 185 % of GDP , largely attributable to public enterprise losses .
US Government assistance is the mainstay of this tiny island economy .
The Marshall Islands received more than $ 1 billion in aid from the US from 1986 - 2002 .
Agricultural production , primarily subsistence , is concentrated on small farms ; the most important commercial crops are coconuts and breadfruit .
Small-scale industry is limited to handicrafts , tuna processing , and copra .
The tourist industry , now a small source of foreign exchange employing less than 10 % of the labor force , remains the best hope for future added income .
The islands have few natural resources , and imports far exceed exports .
Under the terms of the Amended Compact of Free Association , the US will provide millions of dollars per year to the Marshall Islands ( RMI ) through 2023 , at which time a Trust Fund made up of US and RMI contributions will begin perpetual annual payouts .
Government downsizing , drought , a drop in construction , the decline in tourism , and less income from the renewal of fishing vessel licenses have held GDP growth to an average of 1 % over the past decade .
Azerbaijan 's high economic growth during 2006 - 8 was attributable to large and growing oil exports , but some non-export sectors also featured double-digit growth , spurred by growth in the construction , banking , and real estate sectors .
In 2009 , economic growth remained above 9 % even as oil prices moderated and growth in the construction sector cooled .
In 2010 , economic growth slowed to 3.7 % , although the impact of the global financial crisis was less severe than in many other countries in the region .
The current global economic slowdown presents some challenges for the Azerbaijani economy as oil prices remain below their mid-2008 highs , highlighting Azerbaijan 's reliance on energy exports and lackluster attempts to diversify its economy .
Azerbaijan 's oil production increased dramatically in 1997 , when Azerbaijan signed the first production-sharing arrangement ( PSA ) with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company .
Oil exports through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline remain the main economic driver while efforts to boost Azerbaijan 's gas production are underway .
However , Azerbaijan has made only limited progress on instituting market-based economic reforms .
Pervasive public and private sector corruption and structural economic inefficiencies remain a drag on long-term growth , particularly in non-energy sectors .
Several other obstacles impede Azerbaijan 's economic progress : the need for stepped up foreign investment in the non-energy sector and the continuing conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region .
Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet republics is declining in importance , while trade is building with Turkey and the nations of Europe .
Long-term prospects will depend on world oil prices , the location of new oil and gas pipelines in the region , and Azerbaijan 's ability to manage its energy wealth to promote sustainable growth in non-energy sectors of the economy and spur employment .
The Taino - indigenous inhabitants of Hispaniola prior to the arrival of the Europeans - divided the island into five chiefdoms and territories .
Christopher COLUMBUS explored and claimed the island on his first voyage in 1492 ; it became a springboard for Spanish conquest of the Caribbean and the American mainland .
In 1697 , Spain recognized French dominion over the western third of the island , which in 1804 became Haiti .
The remainder of the island , by then known as Santo Domingo , sought to gain its own independence in 1821 but was conquered and ruled by the Haitians for 22 years ; it finally attained independence as the Dominican Republic in 1844 .
In 1861 , the Dominicans voluntarily returned to the Spanish Empire , but two years later they launched a war that restored independence in 1865 .
A legacy of unsettled , mostly non-representative rule followed , capped by the dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas TRUJILLO from 1930 - 61 .
Juan BOSCH was elected president in 1962 but was deposed in a military coup in 1963 .
In 1965 , the United States led an intervention in the midst of a civil war sparked by an uprising to restore BOSCH .
In 1966 , Joaquin BALAGUER defeated BOSCH in an election to become president .
BALAGUER maintained a tight grip on power for most of the next 30 years when international reaction to flawed elections forced him to curtail his term in 1996 .
Since then , regular competitive elections have been held in which opposition candidates have won the presidency .
Former President ( 1996 - 2000 ) Leonel FERNANDEZ Reyna won election to a new term in 2004 following a constitutional amendment allowing presidents to serve more than one term , and was since reelected to a second consecutive term .
Popes in their secular role ruled portions of the Italian peninsula for more than a thousand years until the mid 19th century , when many of the Papal States were seized by the newly united Kingdom of Italy .
In 1870 , the pope 's holdings were further circumscribed when Rome itself was annexed .
Disputes between a series of ' prisoner ' popes and Italy were resolved in 1929 by three Lateran Treaties , which established the independent state of Vatican City and granted Roman Catholicism special status in Italy .
In 1984 , a concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain of the earlier treaty provisions , including the primacy of Roman Catholicism as the Italian state religion .
Present concerns of the Holy See include religious freedom , international development , the environment , the Middle East , China , the decline of religion in Europe , terrorism , interreligious dialogue and reconciliation , and the application of church doctrine in an era of rapid change and globalization .
About 1 billion people worldwide profess the Catholic faith .

The U.S. Justice Department is reopening an investigation into the Bush administration 's domestic surveillance program , marking a major reversal in policy under new Attorney General Michael Mukasey .
The probe will focus on the conduct of Justice Department lawyers in approving the program , which allows the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on the e-mail and telephone conversations of Americans without getting prior approval from a special court .
The Bush administration implemented the program after the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , and said it focused on intercepting international calls and e-mails of Americans and others in the U.S. with suspected terrorism links .
Attorney General Mukasey was formally sworn in Wednesday at a ceremonial event attended by President Bush .
The Justice Department 's Office of Professional Responsibility began the probe in early 2006 , but abandoned it after President Bush denied security clearances to investigators .

The head of Iran 's powerful Guardian Council says his country will withstand any international sanctions over its nuclear program .
Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati told state media Friday that Iran is not afraid of such sanctions .
He expressed confidence that Iran will achieve what he called ' its rights . '
Britain , France and Germany have been pressing Iran to abandon its nuclear enrichment activities .
The United States says the Iranian program is intended to develop a nuclear weapon , a charge Tehran denies .
Last month , the Bush administration and the Europeans backed an International Atomic Energy Agency resolution that says Iran could be referred to the United Nations Security Council if it fails to cooperate fully with IAEA inspectors .
Such a referral could open the way for international sanctions against Tehran .
Nepal 's Defense Ministry says at least 29 people - including Maoist rebels , soldiers and police - have been killed in a fierce gunfight in the western part of the country .
An army statement says the clash occurred late Tuesday in the Palpa area , some 250 kilometers west of the capital , Kathmandu .

Zimbabwe 's economy is growing at a brisk pace despite continuing political uncertainty .
Following a decade of contraction , Zimbabwe 's economy recorded real growth of 5.9 % in 2010 .
But the government of Zimbabwe still faces a number of difficult economic problems , including a large external debt burden and insufficient formal employment .
Zimbabwe 's 1998 - 2002 involvement in the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy .
The government 's land reform program , characterized by chaos and violence , has badly damaged the commercial farming sector , the traditional source of exports and foreign exchange and the provider of 4,00,000 jobs , turning Zimbabwe into a net importer of food products .
The EU and the US provide food aid on humanitarian grounds , though on a smaller scale than before .
Until early 2009 , the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit , causing hyperinflation .
The power-sharing government formed in February 2009 has led to some economic improvements , including the cessation of hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the Zimbabwe dollar and removing price controls .
The economy is registering its first growth in a decade , but will be reliant on further political improvement for greater growth .
All of the following US Pacific island territories except Midway Atoll constitute the Pacific Remote Islands National Wildlife Refuge ( NWR ) Complex and as such are managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service of the US Department of the Interior .
Midway Atoll NWR has been included in a Refuge Complex with the Hawaiian Islands NWR and also designated as part of Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument .
These remote refuges are the most widespread collection of marine- and terrestrial-life protected areas on the planet under a single country 's jurisdiction .
They sustain many endemic species including corals , fish , shellfish , marine mammals , seabirds , water birds , land birds , insects , and vegetation not found elsewhere .
Panama 's dollar-based economy rests primarily on a well-developed services sector that accounts for three-quarters of GDP .
Services include operating the Panama Canal , logistics , banking , the Colon Free Zone , insurance , container ports , flagship registry , and tourism .
Economic growth will be bolstered by the Panama Canal expansion project that began in 2007 and is scheduled to be completed by 2014 at a cost of $ 5.3 billion - about 25 % of current GDP .
The expansion project will more than double the Canal 's capacity , enabling it to accommodate ships that are too large to traverse the existing canal .
The United States and China are the top users of the Canal .
Panama also plans to construct a metro system in Panama City , valued at $ 1.2 billion and scheduled to be completed by 2014 .
Panama 's booming transportation and logistics services sectors , along with aggressive infrastructure development projects , will likely lead the economy to continued growth in 2011 .
Strong economic performance has not translated into broadly shared prosperity , as Panama has the second worst income distribution in Latin America .
About 30 % of the population lives in poverty ; however , from 2006 to 2010 poverty was reduced by 10 percentage points , while unemployment dropped from 12 % to 6 % of the labor force .
Panama and the United States signed a Trade Promotion Agreement in June 2007 , which , when implemented , will help promote the country 's economic growth .

Speculation over the existence of a ' southern land ' was not confirmed until the early 1820s when British and American commercial operators and British and Russian national expeditions began exploring the Antarctic Peninsula region and other areas south of the Antarctic Circle .
Not until 1840 was it established that Antarctica was indeed a continent and not just a group of islands or an area of ocean .
Several exploration ' firsts ' were achieved in the early 20th century , but generally the area saw little human activity .
Following World War II , however , there was an upsurge in scientific research on the continent .
A number of countries have set up a range of year-round and seasonal stations , camps , and refuges to support scientific research in Antarctica .
Seven have made territorial claims , but not all countries recognize these claims .
In order to form a legal framework for the activities of nations on the continent , an Antarctic Treaty was negotiated that neither denies nor gives recognition to existing territorial claims ; signed in 1959 , it entered into force in 1961 .
Tourism is the mainstay of the small open Aruban economy , together with offshore banking .
Oil refining and storage ended in 2009 .
The rapid growth of the tourism sector over the last decade has resulted in a substantial expansion of other activities .
Over 1.5 million tourists per year visit Aruba with 75 % of those from the US .
Construction continues to boom with hotel capacity five times the 1985 level .
Tourist arrivals rebounded strongly following a dip after the 11 September 2001 attacks .

Australia says such a pact could prevent criticism of the human rights records of countries such as Burma .
Iran is facing calls to hand over sensitive nuclear documents for analysis , one day after it escaped immediate referral to the United Nations Security Council for its nuclear activities .
At a meeting Friday in Vienna of the International Atomic Energy Agency 's 35-member board , Britain called for Iran to allow the five main nuclear powers to examine what some experts say are designs for making the explosive core of a nuclear warhead .
Iran insists it did not ask for the designs but was given them by Pakistan 's nuclear black market network run by disgraced scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan .
The call for examination comes as a report circulating in Vienna says Iran 's top nuclear officials met late last month to discuss resuming their enrichment program .
In August , Iran restarted uranium conversion - a precursor to enrichment .
That move prompted Europe to break off nuclear talks with Tehran .
The United States is considering boosting the number of troops it has in Iraq ahead of elections there set for Jan. 27 .
The deputy commander of the U.S. Central Command , Lt.-Gen. Lance Smith , told Friday , the number of additional troops would depend on the security situation following the assault on Fallujah , but would ' probably be an additional brigade 's worth of forces ' -- up to several thousand soldiers .

He told English to Africa reporter William Eagle that his group is offering several suggestions to improve the conduct of the elections .
One is to train monitors how to look for human rights violations , such as withholding access to food .
Another is to watch for attacks on all parties before , during and after the polls .
Amnesty says any violations should then be publicly denounced and reported to authorities .
The group says monitors should also have access to all sectors of the population - since many violations occur far away from polling stations .

He told British television Sunday , ending those subsidies would allow African countries to compete better , reducing their need for international aid .
President Bush will attend he Group of Eight Summit this week , which will discuss aid to Africa .
But farm subsidies are very popular in France and Germany , and the U.S. challenge is not thought likely to be accepted .

He said the 1997 U.N. Kyoto protocol , which Washington never ratified , would have ruined the American economy with its mandated reductions on carbon emissions .
Mr. Bush favors a focus on clean technologies to counter climate change .
An Iranian news report quotes a top nuclear official as saying Tehran will ' seriously and enthusiastically ' study a Russian proposal to enrich uranium from Iran on Russian soil .
The comments by Javad Vaeedi , the deputy head of Iran 's National Security Council , were reported Wednesday by the Iranian Student News Agency .
The United States and the European Union have voiced grave concerns that without oversight , Tehran will process uranium to the highly enriched level needed to make an atomic bomb .
Tehran says it is seeking a lower grade of enriched uranium to fuel a nuclear power plant .

One-party rule ended in 1995 with the first democratic elections held in the country since the 1970s .
Zanzibar 's semi-autonomous status and popular opposition have led to two contentious elections since 1995 , which the ruling party won despite international observers ' claims of voting irregularities .
The formation of a government of national unity between Zanzibar 's two leading parties succeeded in minimizing electoral tension in 2010

From 2004 to 2007 , the economy grew about 10 % per year , driven largely by an expansion in the garment sector , construction , agriculture , and tourism .
GDP contracted slightly in 2009 as a result of the global economic slowdown , but climbed more than 4 % in 1010 , driven by renewed exports .
With the January 2005 expiration of a WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing , Cambodian textile producers were forced to compete directly with lower-priced countries such as China , India , Vietnam , and Bangladesh .
The garment industry currently employs more than 2,80,000 people - about 5 % of the work force - and contributes more than 70 % of Cambodia 's exports .
In 2005 , exploitable oil deposits were found beneath Cambodia 's territorial waters , representing a new revenue stream for the government if commercial extraction begins .
Mining also is attracting significant investor interest , particularly in the northern parts of the country .
The government has said opportunities exist for mining bauxite , gold , iron and gems .
In 2006 , a US-Cambodia bilateral Trade and Investment Framework Agreement ( TIFA ) was signed , and several rounds of discussions have been held since 2007 .

The tourism industry has continued to grow rapidly , with foreign arrivals exceeding 2 million per year in 2007 - 8 ; however , economic troubles abroad dampened growth in 2009 .
The global financial crisis is weakening demand for Cambodian exports , and construction is declining due to a shortage of credit .
The long-term development of the economy remains a daunting challenge .
The Cambodian government is working with bilateral and multilateral donors , including the World Bank and IMF , to address the country 's many pressing needs .
The major economic challenge for Cambodia over the next decade will be fashioning an economic environment in which the private sector can create enough jobs to handle Cambodia 's demographic imbalance .

Undersecretary-General for Political Affairs Ibrahim Gambari said Damascus has not responded to requests for documents and for interviews with witnesses .
The U.N. Security Council later urged all countries - especially those who it said have ' yet to respond adequately ' - to cooperate fully .
Friday 's news reports say the head of the probe , German prosecutor Detlev Mehlis , will meet shortly with a Syrian representative .
Many in Lebanon have accused Syria of being behind Mr. Hariri 's February 14 assassination - a charge Damascus denies .

The U.S. government is working to bolster troubled banks at a time when officials worry the recession may get worse and hit financial companies even harder .
The U.S. Treasury department and other financial regulators say they will ease the repayment terms of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of aid they have given to banks and make it easier for banks to use government help in the future .
This week , regulators will check banks to see if they have the reserves needed to ' provide the credit necessary to restore economic growth . '
Those banks that can not raise the needed capital from private sources could get additional government help .
After Monday 's announcement , the share prices of two major banks , Citigroup and the Bank of America , rose .
Those firms had seen shares plunge last week after investors grew worried that the banks could not cope with rising credit losses .

The crew of the U.S. space shuttle Atlantis has returned to the southeastern state of Florida to prepare for a new launch attempt on Wednesday .
Their shuttle launch was scrubbed earlier this week when a tropical storm Ernesto was expected to pass near the launch site .
The spacecraft was moved to a hangar , and the six astronauts flew back to their training base in Houston .
If the National Air and Space Administration is not able to launch Atlantis next week , the mission to the International Space Station likely will be postponed until October .
NASA 's plans call for an 11-day mission to the space station , where astronauts will conduct three spacewalks to attach solar panels .
The panels eventually will generate one quarter of the station 's energy .
Israel has moved a step closer to the creation of a moderate , new government .
An ambitious plan to draw Israel 's final borders by 2010 is topping the agenda .
Interim Prime Minister Ehud Olmert 's centrist Kadima Party and the Dovish Labor party have signed a coalition agreement .
It includes a pledge to withdraw from large parts of the West Bank over the next four years .
Under Mr. Olmert 's plan , about 70,000 Jewish settlers would be removed from their homes .
At the same time , Israel would annex big West Bank settlement blocs .
Mr. Olmert says he would prefer to do this as part of an agreement with the Palestinians .
But he believes that is impossible because the Islamic militant group Hamas , which seeks Israel 's destruction , now heads the Palestinian Authority .
Mr. Olmert says if there is no Palestinian peace partner , Israel will withdraw unilaterally .
' We will have to act on the basis of a broad national consensus in Israel and work towards fixing of the permanent border lines even without an agreement . '
Former Palestinian legislator Sabri Saddam says expanding settlements and annexing land will only bring more conflict .
' The unilateral withdrawal is not a solution at all but rather a FALSE disengagement , ' he said .
' What we 're looking for is a final , just and fair peace . '
In addition to Palestinian opposition , Mr. Olmert faces another obstacle to implementing the pullout plan .
His coalition with Labor does not give him a majority in the 120-member Knesset or parliament .
Therefore , he will have to bring the ultra-Orthodox Shas party into the coalition , and Shas opposes the pullout plan .
Analysts say the government could collapse in two or three years , when the time comes to remove tens of thousands settlers from their homes .
Nepal 's parliament has voted to abolish the country 's centuries-old monarchy and change to a republic .

The Russian justice ministry says it will sell off part of oil giant Yukos in order to cover the company 's outstanding back taxes .
Ministry officials said Tuesday the value of a Yukos subsidiary Yuganskneftegaz has been established so the government can prepare for the sale .
Officials say Yukos has been taking too much time in paying its back taxes .
A Russian court ruled Monday the embattled company must pay nearly all of the $ 1.34 billion in fines connected to its 2001 tax bill .
Yukos is already struggling to pay $ 3.4 billion in taxes and fines for 2000 , and $ 2.7 billion in taxes for 2001 .
Government critics charge the actions against Yukos are in retaliation for support the firm 's former chief Mikhail Khodorkovsky gave to the political opposition .

They called the new filing an effort to extend the inquiry into the case .
Khodorkovsky , the former chief of the Yukos Oil Company , is serving eight years in prison for fraud and tax evasion - charges he says were politically motivated because of his support for opposition politicians .
The former oil executive is being held in the Siberian city of Chita , where authorities have been investigating money laundering and theft charges against him .
The probe involves the theft of more than $ 33 million from Yukos subsidiaries .
Pakistani authorities say security forces have captured a high-ranking Taleban leader in Quetta , the capital of southwestern Baluchistan province .
Intelligence officials say Mullah Obaidullah Akhund , a former Taleban defense minister and a close associate of fugitive Taleban leader Mullah Omar , was arrested during a raid on a home earlier this week .
The Pakistani government has not confirmed the arrest .
Akhund would be the most senior leader from the Islamist militia to be nabbed since the Taleban was ousted from power in neighboring Afghanistan in late 2001 .
His arrest follows a surprise visit to Pakistan by U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney , who urged President Pervez Musharraf to do more to stop insurgents from crossing into Afghanistan .
General Musharraf reiterated the country is doing all it can to secure its border and defeat insurgents .
Indian opposition leader Lal Krishna Advani says he will resign as head of the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) .

The rift within the party that Mr. Advani 's comments provoked was temporarily patched over .
Russian President Vladimir Putin has sent new year 's greetings to 80-year old Vassily Kononov , a Soviet partisan in World War II who was convicted in Latvia of war crimes .

The U.S. military has said the attack was well coordinated , with assailants dressed in U.S. military-style uniforms and driving vehicles similar to those used by U.S. troops .
The White House said Wednesday that it would not comment on what it called ' speculation ' about Iranian involvement in the Karbala attack .
But spokesman Tony Snow repeated U.S. warnings to respond ' forcefully ' to anyone trying to kill U.S. troops in Iraq or destabilize the country .
Officials in India say a blast on a packed train that killed at least 12 people and left dozens wounded was apparently caused by a bomb .
The explosion occurred Thursday near the town of Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh state .
The train was traveling from the eastern city of Patna to New Delhi at the time of the explosion .
Local news media reported Friday that bomb experts found traces of the explosive substance RDX ( also known as Hexogen ) in the train .

Negroponte also accused Mr. Chavez of spending millions of dollars on what he called an extravagant foreign policy , at the expense of the Venezuelan people .
He said Mr. Chavez is investing considerable sums of money in politics in other Latin American countries .
The U.S. manufacturing sector expanded in September , suggesting the economy may overcome the effects of the two recent hurricanes .
The strength of the expansion surprised some analysts who were expecting a decline .
Monday 's data came from a survey by the Institute for Supply Managers .
Their index of manufacturing activity grew 5.8 points to a reading of 59.4 .
Any reading over 50 indicates an expanding manufacturing sector .
A separate report from the U.S. Commerce Department Monday said construction spending in the United States climbed to a record high in August .
